This guide will help you to create a new extension with all the dependencies, starter code, and recommended folder pre-created. The starter code comes with pre-implemented OAuth flow and easy-to-set-up webhook configuration.

## What you will learn?

1. [Install FDK CLI](#install-fdk-cli)
2. [Generate the starter code for your extension using FDK CLI](#generate-the-starter-code-for-extension)
3. [Preview your extension on a development account](#preview-your-extension-on-a-development-account)

## Prerequisites

To successfully complete this guide, you will need the following:
* You have created a [partner account](https://partners.fynd.com).
* You have created a [development account](docs/partners/testing-extension/development-acc.md#create-development-account).
* Youâ€™ve installed one of these backend languages and package managers:
  * [Node.js (v16.x)](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) with npm
  * [Java (v17)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) with maven
* You have installed [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
* You have installed [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/install/install-redis/).

## Install FDK CLI

FDK-CLI is a command-line interface tool to simplify the theme and extension development process. You can read the [documentation here](https://github.com/gofynd/fdk-cli).

To install the latest version of FDK-CLI, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g @gofynd/fdk-cli
```
Check if `fdk-cli` is successfully installed by running this command:

```bash
fdk --version
```

If it is installed successfully, it will return the version:

:::tip
To see a list of available commands and their descriptions, use `fdk --help`.

## Generate the starter code for extension

Follow below steps in FDK CLI to generate your extension's starter code:

1. Login in to FDK-CLI using command below:

  ```bash
  fdk login
  ```

  Verify if you are logged in or not by running the following command:
  ```bash
  fdk user
  ```

2. To create the extension run the following command:

  ```bash
  fdk extension init
  ```
  To know more about the init command, [click here](https://github.com/gofynd/fdk-cli/blob/master/README.md#extension-init).

:::note
**Heads up!**

When you run the `fdk extension init` command, you'll get prompted with two choices if you've already set up an extension:

1. Create a new extension
2. Use an existing extension

If you want to kickstart your extension from an existing one, just go with the second option. This will automatically skip steps 3 and 4, saving you some time.
:::

3. Enter **Extension** Name
4. Select Extension Type. You can select between [Private](../publishing/private-extension) and [Public](../publishing/public-extension).
5. Select your preferred technology stack from these options:
    - Node + Vue 3 + SQLite
    - Node + React.js + SQLite
    - Java + Vue 2 + SQLite
    - Java + React.js + SQLite

  ![extension init](https://cdn.pixelbin.io/v2/himanshu01010/original/Extension-build/extension_init_3.png)

  FDK-CLI will create the extension folder into the current directory of the local system with starter code and register the extension in your [Fynd Partners](https://partners.fynd.com/) account. Navigate to Partner Panel > Extensions > Your Extension, to check and edit your extension's registration details

6. Change the directory to your extension directory by running the following command:

  ```javascript
  cd "Example Extension"
  ```

:::info
Internally FDK CLI installs FDK Extension and Client libraries in the starter code which helps in OAuth implementation, calling SDK methods and configuring webhooks. Check out the documentation of these libraries in your preferred technology stack.

#### FDK Extension Libraries

The FDK Extension library facilitates seamless configuration of authentication for accessing Fynd Platform APIs and webhooks subscriptions. OAuth implementation is essential for establishing the necessary foundational authentication for both functionalities. Explore the following libraries in your preferred language.

* [fdk-extension-javascript](https://github.com/gofynd/fdk-extension-javascript)
* [fdk-extension-java](https://github.com/gofynd/fdk-extension-java)

#### FDK Client Libraries

FDK Client Library is a peer dependency in FDK Extension Library and contains all the methods to call Fynd platform API's.

* [fdk-client-javascript](https://github.com/gofynd/fdk-client-javascript)
* [fdk-client-java](https://github.com/gofynd/fdk-client-java)
* [fdk-client-swift](https://github.com/gofynd/fdk-client-swift)
* [fdk-client-kotlin](https://github.com/gofynd/fdk-client-kotlin)

## Preview your extension on a development account

1. Run following `fdk` command to get the extension preview URL.

```bash
fdk extension preview
```
This will start both the frontend and backend server of your extension, then initiate a secure public tunnel to make your extension accessible publicly.


:::info
For more information about this command, check out [this link](https://github.com/gofynd/fdk-cli/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#extension-preview-url).
:::

:::note
To install or preview a Private extension on any company, ensure the company is added as a subscriber to your extension first.
:::

2. Copy Preview URL and paste it into the browser to Install/Launch Extension

Congratulations you have created your first extension. Start building your extension features by using our APIs and SDKs.




## Advance guide

- If you want to use a different environment (cluster) for extension development, you can change the active environment by using the following command:

  ```bash
  fdk login --host your-partner-domain
  ```
  This command will change the active environment to the provided cluster host. For example, if your partner account exists at partners.fynd.com, you should use:
  ```bash
  fdk login --host partners.fynd.com
  ```
  This will set the active environment to the Fynd cluster.
